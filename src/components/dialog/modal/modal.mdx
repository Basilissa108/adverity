# Modal

This component renders a dialog on top of an overlay. Use it to display important messages or to break down complex workflows.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
    {() => {
        const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);
        return (
            <>
                <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Trigger modal</Button>
                {isOpen && (
                    <Modal
                        title="Modal component"
                        onSubmit={() => setIsOpen(false)}
                        onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}
                    >
                        <Toast variant="info">
                            Some important message.
                        </Toast>
                    </Modal>
                )}
            </>
        );
    }}

</Playground>

## Guidelines

### Header

Choose a descriptive `title` for the modal, it is used as `aria-label` for the modal as well to give the user an idea of the content that the modal contains.

### Content

Make sure the content is appropriate for a modal, if you have a lot of content, consider breaking it down into smaller steps and create a flow guiding the user through multiple modals.

### Footer

By default the footer contains a secondary cancel button and a primary call-to-action button.

The cancel button calls the function provided as `onClose` prop which is intended to hide the modal and if appropriate reset state such as form values that were displayed in the modal. You can hide this button by setting `hideCancel` to `true`.

The call-to-action button is calling the function provided as `onSubmit` prop, and is intended for completing the task the modal is used for, either acknowledging the message or completing a form or similar actions. The label of this button defaults to "Submit", if you need a custom label set it with the `submitButtonText` prop.

You can display additional actions in the modal footer's left side by providing an array of `Button` components as `additionalActions` prop.
